## Hi there, I’m Mahitha Balumuri! 👋

I’m a **Software Engineer** and **Master’s graduate in Computer Science** at the University at Buffalo. With a knack for building scalable systems and a passion for machine learning, I’ve spent over two years crafting solutions that make a difference—think health platforms for 10,000+ users and deepfake detectors with 98% accuracy. I thrive at the intersection of code, creativity, and real-world impact.

### 🌍 About Me
- **Background**: Hailing from India, I earned my B.Tech in Computer Science from Gandhi Institute of Technology and Management. I’m now a Master’s graduate in Computer Science from the 
  University at Buffalo. Along the way, I built real-world expertise as a Software Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services in Hyderabad (2021-2023), tackling scalable platforms and cloud 
   migrations, and kicked things off with a hands-on internship at TCS in Mumbai (2021), diving into data mapping and CI/CD pipelines.
- **Currently**: Living in Buffalo, NY, diving into **deep learning**, **cloud tech**, and **computer vision** while sipping coffee and chasing snowy sunsets.
- **Fun Fact**: I once cut manual effort by 50% with Kubernetes automation scripts—because who doesn’t love efficiency with a side of chai?

### 🔧 My Tech Toolbox
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript, C/C++, Java, C#, .NET Core, MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Web Dev**: React, Angular, Vue.js, Node.js, Spring Boot, REST, GraphQL, Next.js, React Native
- **ML & Data**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, PySpark, Hadoop, OpenCV
- **Tools & Cloud**: Azure, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Splunk, Kafka, Git, Jira, SonarQube
- **Methodologies**: Agile, CI/CD, TDD (Jest, 90% code coverage? Yes, please!)

### 💼 What I’ve Built
- **Software Engineer @ TCS (2021-2023)**  
  - Engineered a health plan platform for Kaiser Permanente, scaling it for 10,000+ daily users with React, Java, and Spring Boot—boosted API performance by 25%.  
  - Migrated services to Azure, slashing costs by 20% and improving scalability by 40%, all while keeping an eye on Splunk dashboards.  
  - Led UI enhancements with Adobe Analytics, driving 20% more user engagement.

- **Intern @ TCS (2021)**  
  - Built a data mapping tool in Angular for asset management, cutting processing time by 30% with Node.js APIs and MSSQL integration.

### 🌟 Featured Projects
- **[Workplace Mental Health Prediction]**  
  A 95% accurate ML system (SVM, Random Forest) with a React dashboard—because mental health matters.  
- **[Deepfake Image Classification]**  
  A 98% accurate deep learning model (AlexNet, ResNet, ViT) to fight misinformation—fake images don’t stand a chance.  
- **[State Property Management]**  
  A PostgreSQL-powered system with Streamlit UI, optimized for 40% faster queries.  
- **[Pintos OS]**  
  Tweaked CPU scheduling in a Unix-based OS—priority donation never felt so satisfying.

### 📚 What I’m Learning
- **Full-Stack**: Mastering end-to-end development with Next.js and GraphQL for seamless, scalable web apps.  
- **Cloud**: Diving deeper into AWS and Kubernetes to orchestrate resilient, cloud-native systems.  
- **Machine Learning**: Exploring advanced neural networks in PyTorch to push the boundaries of computer vision.
